Advanced Minesweeper 

*Member(s): Fatemeh Fereidoonpour 

*What is Advanced Minesweeper? 

It’s a developed version of Minesweeper game which you can play in your leisure and have fun 

*Where does the idea come from? 

One day, I was playing Minesweeper in my free time and then thought what if I could develop it to be a more usable version. 

The first problem was that I have played that game too much so I was sick of it but I still wanted to play that so I decided to add a fourth mode which you can choose row and column by yourself. 

And then, I decided to make it more interesting and also choose mines yourself (which you can plan so that its difficulty level is very hard to very easy, which greatly increases the user’s maneuverability. And also, you can build many more modes and play them.) 

*Beneficiaries: All bored human being 

*Requirements: Having a program which have ability to run c++ 

*Programming language: c++ 

*Users scenarios: After running the program, select one of four available modes and have fun 

*Project schedule: 5 days for writing whole code 

                 		  3 days for developed and debugging 

*How to run: open file in a program which can open c++ and then run 

*Pluralization: one of the challenges I faced was cluttering code output for a two digit row or column
